Contributions:

Raiyan:
- Worked on Exercise 2 
  - Derived and proved that Random Search needs at least 2^(n/2) evaluations with probability 1 - e^(-Î©(n)) on F1 (OneMax) to reach optimum search point 
  - Derived and proved that both RLS and (1+1) EA reach optimal search point on F3 in O(n log n) evaluations with constant probability
