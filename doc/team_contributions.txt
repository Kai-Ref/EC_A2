Contributions:

Dylan:
- Worked on Exercise 2 
  - Developed the RLS EA and the (1+1) EA in Exercise 2 Python Script
  - Ran Random Search, RLS, and (1+1) for functions specified in Exercise 2 and wrote results summary

Raiyan:
- Worked on Exercise 2 
  - Derived and proved that Random Search needs at least 2^(n/2) evaluations with probability 1 - e^(-Î©(n)) on F1 (OneMax) to reach optimum search point 
  - Derived and proved that both RLS and (1+1) EA reach optimal search point on F3 in O(n log n) evaluations with constant probability

Gabriel:
- Worked on Exercise 5
  - Developed custom ACO and ran testing and tuning
  - Wrote analysis of custom ACO and compared results with MMAS and MMAS*

Kai:
- Worked on Exercise 4
  - Conducted experiments with different parameter settings (p in {1, 0.1, 0.001}) for MMAS and MMAS*
  - Analyzed results and wrote summary of observations and comparisons with Exercise 2

Marcel:
- Worked on Exercise 4
